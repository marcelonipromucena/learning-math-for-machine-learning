<h2>
- Jill designs solar panels as a hobby;
</h2>
<h2>
- On April 1st, Jill's "Mark I" design begins generating power 1Kj/day;
</h2>
<h2>
- On May 1st, her "Mark II" design begins generating 4Kj/day;
<h2>

Problem:
<h2>
1 - What day is it when Jill's Mark II design has generated as much total energy as the Mark I design?
</h2>
<h2>
2 - How much total energy have both generated by that day?
</h2>
<h2>
3 - What would the solutions to 1 and 2 be if Mark II design generated 1Kj/day?
</h2>
&nbsp;

<h1>Solutions</h1>

<h2>Solution 1:</h2>

# $1t = 4(t-30) $
# $1t = 4t-120 $
# $-3t = -120 $
# $t = {\frac{120}{3}} = 40 $ days
&nbsp;
<h2>Solution 2:</h2>

# $1t = 1(40) = 40Kj $
# $ 4(t - 30) = 4(40-30) = 4(10) = 40Kj $
# $ 40 +  40 = 80Kj $ total produced by both.  
&nbsp;

<h2>Solution 3:</h2>

# No solution because both values are equal.
