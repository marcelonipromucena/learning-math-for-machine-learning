## Context

- Jill designs solar panels as a hobby;
- On April 1st, Jill's "Mark I" design begins generating power 1Kj/day;
- On May 1st, her "Mark II" design begins generating 4Kj/day;


## Problem:
1 - What day is it when Jill's Mark II design has generated as much total energy as the Mark I design?
2 - How much total energy have both generated by that day?
3 - What would the solutions to 1 and 2 be if Mark II design generated 1Kj/day?

## Solutions
  
### Solution for problem 1:

$$ 1t = 4(t-30)$$
$$1t = 4t-120$$
$$-3t = -120$$
$$ t = \left(\frac{120}{3}\right) = 40 days$$ 


### Solution for problem 2:

$$ 1t = 1(40) = 40Kj$$
$$4(t - 30) = 4(40-30) = 4(10) = 40Kj$$
$$40 + Â 40 = 80Kj$$ 

### Solution 3:

 ==No solution because both values are equal.==
